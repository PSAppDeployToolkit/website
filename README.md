# PSAppDeployToolkit Documentation and Website

This repository holds the documentation for PSAppDeployToolkit which can be found [here](https://psappdeploytoolkit.com).

## Contributing

If you feel like you can contribute, please do so by opening an issue or pull request. We are always open to expand our documentation and add new features.

## Local Development

We are using pnpm to manage our dependencies. We've found it to be more reliable than either `yarn` or `npm`. You can download `pnpm` from [here](https://pnpm.io). Then you can install the dependencies by running:

```powershell
pnpm install
```

To start a local development server and opens up a browser window, run the following:

```powershell
pnpm start
```

Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).
