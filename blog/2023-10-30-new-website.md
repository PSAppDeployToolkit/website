## New Website

Oh wow, this has been a long time coming! Oh ... I'm not talking about the long overdue v4. I'm talking about the new website!

PSAppDeployToolkit is feeling revitalized, and kinda cute, so it was only fair that we apply a fresh coat of paint to the site. And it's not just a little bit of paint, we've been working on this for a while now.

### What's New?

We've completely re-built the site from the ground up, and we've added a bunch of new features. We've invested a lot of time in improving the flow of the documentation, so it's easier to follow and quicker to get up to speed with the toolkit.

And we've created an all-important reference guide for the toolkit's Exit Codes, Variables and Functions to the top of the page, so it's easy to find.

## Stay Tuned

This isn't the only new thing on the horizon. More news very very soon.

Dan, Sean & Mo.
