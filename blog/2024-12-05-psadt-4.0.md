## PSADT 4.0 details

Yesterday was just one of those days. There was so much to do that I completely forgot to write a blog post to announce that we finally did it! We finally released PSAppDeployToolkit v4.0!

This is by far, the biggest release we've ever done. Quite a lot has changed, but we've gone to great lengths to provide backwards compatibility with existing v3 deployments, as well as tools to seamlessly migrate your existing v3 deployment scripts into our new v4 format. And why would you want to move to using v4?
