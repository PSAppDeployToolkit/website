## PSAppDeployToolkit v4.1.6

PSAppDeployToolkit v4.1.6 is now available. This is a substantial bugfix and improvement release that addresses many issues reported by the community since v4.1.0.

### Highlights

#### URL formatting in dialog strings

You can now format URLs with descriptive text in your dialog messages using tags:

```
[url=https://contoso.com/security]Click here for the IT Security Policy[/url]
```

Nested tags for bold, italic, and accent formatting are also now supported.

#### Fluent UI software rendering

Fluent Dialogs now use software rendering mode, which resolves issues with remote assistance and control tools such as ScreenConnect and other similar products.

#### EPM compatibility

Fixed an issue where the UI could fail to display when `explorer.exe` is being elevated by an Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) rule using BeyondTrust EPM, Microsoft EPM, or other EPM tools.

### Key fixes in this release

- **Copy-ADTFile**: All known issues resolved
- **Start-ADTProcessAsUser**: Now works with the caller's username even without an active session
- **Start-ADTProcess**: Fixed `-ArgumentList` parameter incorrectly resolving `$adtSession` property to `True`
- **Start-ADTMsiProcess**: Fixed failure to uninstall an installed MSI
- **Test-ADTOobeCompleted / Test-ADTEspActive**: Fixed not working
- **Remove-ADTEnvironmentVariable**: Fixed only removing the value instead of the variable itself
- **New-ADTZipFile**: Fixed not working
- **Get-ADTShortcut**: Fixed not working for URL shortcuts
- **v3 compatibility**: Fixed passing parameters from the command-line to a v3 compatibility template
- **Classic Dialogs**: Tags are now correctly stripped from dialog strings (formatting only works in Fluent UI)
