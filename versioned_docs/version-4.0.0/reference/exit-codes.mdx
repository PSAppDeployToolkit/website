# Exit Codes

PSAppDeployToolkit uses pre-defined exit codes to indicate whether a deployment succeeds or fails. You can use these codes to control deployment flow or to understand what occurred.

| Exit Code     | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 60006         | AllowSystemInteractionFallback option was not selected in the config XML file, so toolkit will not fall back to SYSTEM context with no interaction.                          |
| 60007         | `Invoke-AppDeployToolkit.ps1` failed to dot source `AppDeployToolkitMain.ps1` either because it could not be found or there was an error while it was being dot sourced.     |
| 60008         | The `-UserName` parameter in the `Start-ADTProcessAsUser` function has a default value that is empty because no logged in users were detected when the toolkit was launched. |

| 60012         | A UI prompt can time out or the user may defer the installation, which produces exit code 60012.                                                                             |
