# Reference

PSAppDeployToolkit has various functions to help speed up writing scripts. It also uses the 'ADT Session object' to store information about each deployment, and provides a number of properties to simplify your scripting, and make your life easier.

PSAppDeployToolkit uses pre-defined **Exit Codes** to indicate the success or failure of a deployment and can be used to control the flow of your deployment logic, or just to understand what happened during a deployment.

You can find the full list of Exit Codes, Functions and ADT Session object properties in the sidebar to the left. You can also use the search bar at the top of the page.
