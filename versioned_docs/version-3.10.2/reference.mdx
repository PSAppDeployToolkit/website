# Reference

PSAppDeployToolkit uses pre-defined **Exit Codes** to indicate the success or failure of a deployment and can be used to control the flow of your deployment logic, or just to understand what happened during a deployment.

For script development, PSAppDeployToolkit defines a wide range of **Variables** and **Functions** which you can use to speed up your deployment, simplify your scripting, and make your life easier.

You can find the full list of Exit Codes, Variables and Functions in the sidebar to the left. You can also use the search bar at the top of the page.
