| `AppDeployToolkitConfig.xml`     | PSAppDeployToolkit global configuration file. Used by the `AppDeployToolkitMain.ps1` script, and sets default values for how the toolkit should behave overall.

| `AppDeployToolkitMain.ps1`       | Contains all of the functions and logic used by the installation script. By Separating the logic from the installation script, we can obfuscate away the complex code and make enhancements independently of the installation scripts that contain per-application actions.                                            |
