## Exit Codes

PSAppDeployToolkit uses pre-defined Exit Codes to indicate the success or failure of a deployment and can be used to control the flow of your deployment logic, or just to understand what happened during a deployment.

| Exit Code     | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |

| 60006         | AllowSystemInteractionFallback option was not selected in the config XML file, so toolkit will not fall back to SYSTEM context with no interaction.                         |
