- PSAppDeployToolkit has an **extensive library of functions** to simplify common deployment tasks. Every function adheres to the same security standards and best practices, including documentation.
- The **`ADTSession`** object is a core component of PSAppDeployToolkit, managing the state and information throughout a deployment session. It gathers essential details about the deployment environment and provides convenient properties and methods for use in scripts.
- When you open an `ADTSession` several useful **Variables** are created. These include hardware information, system and user paths, and Active Directory domain details, among others.
- PSADT provides comprehensive **Configuration Settings** through multiple layers.
- You can customize all of the User Interface text strings for English or any other language using **Language Strings**.
- PSADT supports rich **Text Formatting** in dialog messages, allowing you to create more visually appealing and informative user interfaces.
- Pre-defined **Exit Codes** are used to indicate the success or failure of a deployment and can be used to control the flow of your deployment logic, or just to understand what happened during a deployment.
