# Reference

PSAppDeployToolkit provides various functions to simplify script writing and uses an ADT Session object to store deployment information.

PSAppDeployToolkit uses pre-defined **Exit Codes** to indicate the success or failure of a deployment and can be used to control the flow of your deployment logic, or just to understand what happened during a deployment.

You can find a complete list of Exit Codes, Functions, and ADT Session properties in the sidebar or by using the search bar.
