# Creating a new deployment

:::info

A **deployment template** contains the source files for an application deployment, the deployment script that defines the deployment logic, and the PSADT module and configuration. It is typically entirely self-contained and can be shared with others to deploy the application in a consistent manner.

:::

## Using the module

The PSAppDeployToolkit module can create a new deployment from PSADT's internal templates.

To create a new deployment using the PSADT v3 compatible template, run:

```powershell
New-ADTTemplate -Destination C:\Temp -Name "PSAppDeployToolkitv3" -Version 3
```

To create a new deployment using the PSADT v4 native deployment template, run:

```powershell
New-ADTTemplate -Destination C:\Temp -Name "PSAppDeployToolkitv4"
```

## Using the downloadable templates

The PSAppDeployToolkit GitHub Releases page includes several templates for creating a new deployment.

- `PSAppDeployToolkit_Template_v3.zip` - PSADT v3 compatible deployment template
- `PSAppDeployToolkit_Template_v4.zip` - PSADT v4 native deployment template


To create a new deployment using the templates, follow these steps:

1. Download the PSAppDeployToolkit template you require from the [PSAppDeployToolkit GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit/releases/latest).
2. Extract the contents to a folder on your computer.
3. Open the folder and review the contents. We will discuss the contents in the next section.
