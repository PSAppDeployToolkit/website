# Deployment Script

The `Invoke-AppDeployToolkit.ps1` script is where you will spend most of your time when using PSAppDeployToolkit. This script is the main entry point of the deployment, responsible for executing the deployment phases.

## Deployment Types

The script is broken down into three main deployment types:

- `Install`
- `Uninstall`
- `Repair`

## Deployment Phases

Use `Pre-InstallType`, `InstallType`, and `Post-InstallType` phases to organize tasks for installation, uninstallation, or repair.

## Script

The script is broken down into the following sections:

| **Install Type**          | **Phase**        | **Deployment Tasks**                                                                |
