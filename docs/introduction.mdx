## What is PSAppDeployToolkit?

A *PowerShell* based framework, to **simplify and standardize** the process of **deploying software** to **Windows** based computers, ***at scale***.

It is typically used to wrap an existing vendor-supplied installer package (e.g. source files containing an MSI or EXE file), and to extend it's functionality using:

- A standardized, battle-tested **workflow** for every application install, uninstall and repair.
- A highly-customizable **User Interface** that remains consistent for end users, for every deployment.
- An extensive **library of functions** to simplify common deployment tasks.

... which results in a **consistent and brandable user experience** and **highly successful deployments**.

In this documentation, you'll find information on how to quickly get up and running with PSADT, how to get to grips with creating you first deployment, guides on how to use some of the more advanced features, and a reference for every function and variable available to use.
