# Upgrade Guidance: v3.x to v4.1

Before proceeding, ensure that you have reviewed the changes in the [release notes(../getting-started/release-notes.mdx)

## Using v4 in v3 Compatibility Mode

See the [Creating a new deployment](../getting-started/creating-a-new-deployment.mdx) page for instructions on creating a v3-compatible deployment template or downloading one from GitHub.

This layout allows you to drop in your existing v3 **Deploy-Application.ps1** scripts (along with **AppDeployToolkit\AppDeployToolkitExtensions.ps1**), which will continue to function with the following caveats:

- If you customized **config.xml** in your previous v3 deployment, you will now need to modify **Config\config.psd1** and/or **Strings\strings.psd1** accordingly.
- Copy your custom banner to **Assets\Banner.Classic.png**.
- Compatibility mode does not support the new Fluent UI.

## Migration Tools in PSAppDeployToolkit.Tools

[PSAppDeployToolkit.Tools](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit.Tools) provides the following commands to help you migrate from v3:

- **Test-ADTCompatibility** - Tests your PSAppDeployToolkit v3 scripts to generate a full report on which functions and variables have changed in v4.
- **Convert-ADTDeployment** - Converts a PSAppDeployToolkit v3 script or an entire package folder to v4 standards.

The [Downloading](../getting-started/download.mdx) page covers how to download and install this additional module.

### Test-ADTCompatibility

Example command usage:

```powershell
Test-ADTCompatibility -FilePath .\Deploy-Application.ps1 -Format Grid
```

This command analyzes **Deploy-Application.ps1** and displays the results in a grid view.

### Convert-ADTDeployment

Example command usage:

```powershell
Convert-ADTDeployment -Path .\Deploy-Application.ps1
```
This command converts **Deploy-Application.ps1** to **Invoke-AppDeployToolkit.ps1** in the same folder.

```powershell
Convert-ADTDeployment -Path .\PackageFolder
```
This command converts **PackageFolder** to **PackageFolder_Converted** in the same folder.

Conversion limitations:

- Known toolkit variables, such as `$appName`, are copied over to the hashtable that creates `$adtSession`.
- The main Install, Uninstall, and Repair scriptblocks are converted and copied to the new script.
- Any other custom variables, function declarations, or code located outside these blocks will not be transferred.
- **Files** and **SupportFiles** contents are transferred if a package folder is supplied as the path rather than a **Deploy-Application.ps1** file.
- **Config.xml** changes will not be ported to the new .psd1 files.
- Customized assets or banners are not currently copied over.

**PSAppDeployToolkit.Tools** is currently in pre-release to gather early feedback. If you encounter any conversion issues, please submit a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit.Tools/issues).
