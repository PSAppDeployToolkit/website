# Creating a new deployment

:::info

A **deployment template** contains the source files for an application deployment, the deployment script itself which is the logic for how the application should be deployed, and the PSADT module and configuration itself. It is typically entirely self-contained and can be shared with others to deploy the application in a consistent manner.

:::

## Using the module

The PSAppDeployToolkit module can create a new deployment from PSADT's internal templates.

To create a new deployment using the PSADT v3 compatible deployment template, use the following PowerShell command:

```powershell
New-ADTTemplate -Destination C:\Temp\MyAppDeployment -Name "MyOldAppDeployment" -Version 3
```

To create a new deployment using the PSADT v4 native deployment template, use the following PowerShell command:

```powershell
New-ADTTemplate -Destination C:\Temp\MyAppDeployment -Name "MyAppDeployment"
```

## Using the downloadable templates

The PSAppDeployToolkit Github Releases page includes a number of templates that can be used to create a new deployment.

- `PSAppDeployToolkit_Template_v3.zip` - PSADT v3 compatible deployment template
- `PSAppDeployToolkit_Template_v4.zip` - PSADT v4 native deployment template


To create a new deployment using the templates, follow these steps:

1. Download the PSAppDeployToolkit template you require from the [PSAppDeployToolkit GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit/releases/latest).

2. Extract the contents to a folder on your computer.

3. Open the folder and review the contents. We will discuss the contents in the next section.
