### v4.1 (2025-08-07)

#### Major Improvements

- Up until now, it was not possible to display any user interface when deploying an application as SYSTEM using Intune (or any endpoint management tool) without using ServiceUI. Well, now it IS possible:
  - In fact, we strongly advise you stop using it as soon as possible. ServiceUI works by manipulating system security tokens in a way that could allow malicious actors to escalate privileges or bypass security controls.
  - We've taken a fresh approach which leverages the Windows security model and separates out user interactions onto a process running in the users' session - we never perform any user interaction or messaging of any kind within the SYSTEM context. This means a more secure and reliable deployment experience.
  - We have also removed the requirement for the 'Allow users to view and interact with the program installation' checkbox in Configuration Manager deployments.

- There is now **full feature parity** between the Fluent and Classic User Interfaces:
  - Deferral Deadline and Countdown Timer on Close Apps Dialog
  - Ability to prevent the Restart Dialog from being dismissed once a certain point in the countdown is reached
  - Ability to allow users to move dialogs
  - Ability to set the initial dialog placement to multiple locations
  - PowerShell ISE compatibility

- Furthermore, the Fluent UI has gained new features:
  - Due to the rearchitecture of how we handle user interaction with Dialogs, it is now possible to prompt the user for input using [Show-ADTInstallationPrompt](../reference/functions/Show-ADTInstallationPrompt)'s `-InputBox` parameter
  - Support for formattable text (Bold, Italic & Accent) as well as URL hyperlinks in dialog messages
  - You can now set the % complete of the progress bar in the Progress Dialog (for example, if you are running a custom script that you want to show incremental progress changes for)
  - Ability to set different icons for Light / Dark mode

- The security rearchitecture required all of our process execution code to be rewritten. This has enabled us to provide a wealth of new capabilities to both [Start-ADTProcess](../reference/functions/Start-ADTProcess) and [Start-ADTProcessAsUser](../reference/functions/Start-ADTProcessAsUser) using the following new parameters:
  - `-UseUnelevatedToken` parameter to force a process run without elevation, for deploying user-context apps with Windows 11 Administrator Protection enabled
  - `-WaitForChildProcesses` parameter to wait for all child processes to end - useful for installers/uninstallers that hand off to another process and exit early
  - `-KillChildProcessesWithParent` parameter to close all started child processes once main process has ended - useful when installers start the application post-install, which is typically undesired when running as system
  - `-Timeout` parameter along with supporting `-TimeoutAction` and `-NoTerminateOnTimeout` parameters to control the outcome
  - `-ExpandEnvironmentVariables` parameter to allow variable expansion such as `%AppData%` when running a process as a user
  - `-StreamEncoding` parameter, useful for apps like `Winget` that write to the console using `UTF8`
  - `-PassThru` output now has a new `interleaved` property that combines `stdout`/`stderr` in order
- It's now possible to set PSADT configuration settings via Group Policy using the included ADMX templates, which will override any settings in the `config.psd1` file. This allows you to change, update or enforce settings across an organization.

#### ️ New and Enhanced Functions

- Added functions for managing user / machine environment variables:
  - [Get-ADTEnvironmentVariable](../reference/functions/Get-ADTEnvironmentVariable) / [Set-ADTEnvironmentVariable](../reference/functions/Set-ADTEnvironmentVariable) / [Remove-ADTEnvironmentVariable](../reference/functions/Remove-ADTEnvironmentVariable)
- Added functions for managing INI file sections / values:
  - [Get-ADTIniSection](../reference/functions/Get-ADTIniSection) / [Set-ADTIniSection](../reference/functions/Set-ADTIniSection) / [Remove-ADTIniSection](../reference/functions/Remove-ADTIniSection)
  - [Get-ADTIniValue](../reference/functions/Get-ADTIniValue) / [Set-ADTIniValue](../reference/functions/Set-ADTIniValue) / [Remove-ADTIniValue](../reference/functions/Remove-ADTIniValue)
- Added [Start-ADTMsiProcessAsUser](../reference/functions/Start-ADTMsiProcessAsUser) for installing / uninstalling user-context MSIs via the System account
- Added [Test-ADTEspActive](../reference/functions/Test-ADTEspActive) to test for an active Enrollment Status Page (ESP)
- Added `-DeferRunInterval` switch to [Show-ADTInstallationWelcome](../reference/functions/Show-ADTInstallationWelcome) to limit retry times from Intune
- Added `-Path` / `-LiteralPath` support to registry functions
- Added volatile key creation support to [Set-ADTRegistryKey](../reference/functions/Set-ADTRegistryKey)
- Added `MultiString` add / remove support to [Set-ADTRegistryKey](../reference/functions/Set-ADTRegistryKey)
- Added `-MaximumElapsedTime` parameter to [Invoke-ADTCommandWithRetries](../reference/functions/Invoke-ADTCommandWithRetries)
- Added `-SuccessExitCodes` and `-RebootExitCodes` parameters to [Uninstall-ADTApplication](../reference/functions/Uninstall-ADTApplication)

#### ️ Other Improvements

- [Show-ADTHelpConsole](../reference/functions/Show-ADTHelpConsole) has been given some love and a facelift with High-DPI awareness, resizability, PowerShell 7 compatibility, and extension module display
- Reworked `Invoke-AppDeployToolkit.exe` to be more compliant within `WDAC` environments
- Added `-NoWait` support to [Show-ADTDialogBox](../reference/functions/Show-ADTDialogBox)
- Added process detection code to enable automatic silent deployments when processes aren't running
- Added `/Debug` switch to [Invoke-AppDeployToolkit.exe](../deployment-concepts/invoke-appdeploytoolkit) to show terminal output for debugging purposes
- Added `/Core` switch to [Invoke-AppDeployToolkit.exe](../deployment-concepts/invoke-appdeploytoolkit) to allow PowerShell 7 usage
- Added support for running processes from network drives

#### ️ Changes

- Added `-NoOobeDetection` option to `Open-ADTSession` to bypass `OOBE` detection logic when `DeployMode` is set to `Auto`. Use this to show the UI during `OOBE` / Autopilot `ESP` phases.
- Added `-NoSessionDetection` option to `Open-ADTSession` to bypass session detection logic when `DeployMode` is set to `Auto`. Use this to show the UI when no user is logged on and the `SYSTEM` process is interactive.
- Added `-NoProcessDetection` option to `Open-ADTSession` to bypass process detection logic when `DeployMode` is set to `Auto`. Use this to show the UI even if there are no processes to close.
- Changed `-DeployMode` `Interactive` to always show interactively. This means the toolkit will always show the dialogs, bypassing the `OOBE`/`Session`/`Process` detections that occur in `Auto` mode.
- Changed default `DeferExitCode` from `60012` to `1602`, since `ConfigMgr` and Intune recognize this natively as 'User cancelled the installation'
- Changed toolkit to exit with `3010` if a suppressed reboot was encountered without having to use `-AllowRebootPassThru`. To mask `3010` return codes and exit with `0`, you can now add `-SuppressRebootPassThru`
- Changed default `msiexec.exe` parameters in interactive mode from `/qb-!` to `/qn`
- Changed UI functions to no longer minimize windows by default, `-MinimizeWindows` can be added to enable this
- Changed the 'Processes to close' in the `Invoke-AppDeployToolkit` template to the `AppProcessesToClose` `ADTSession` parameter, where they can be re-used over Install / Uninstall / Repair
- Changed installation failure to be silent as it was in v3.x; however, you can still uncomment a line to get the full detailed stack trace as used in v4.0.x, or a new minimal example using the Fluent UI

#### Fixes

- Fixed [Start-ADTProcessAsUser](../reference/functions/Start-ADTProcessAsUser) function to work as expected
- Fixed [Block-ADTAppExecution](../reference/functions/Block-ADTAppExecution) to avoid triggering AV solutions
- Fixed dialogs to show correct deployment type Install / Uninstall / Repair
- Fixed `SCCM` pending reboot tests within [Get-ADTPendingReboot](../reference/functions/Get-ADTPendingReboot)
- Fixed MSI repair to default to 'Reinstall' to avoid forced unavoidable reboots when running `msiexec` `/f` against an app that is in-use
- Fixed `OOBE` detection code to factor in User `ESP` phase
- Fixed launching processes in the users' session when using certain MDMs, e.g. VMware Workspace ONE.

#### New Configuration Format

- Changed to .psd1 as the native PowerShell config file format. See [Customizing Deployments](../usage/customizing-deployments.mdx) for more information.

#### Key Function Name Changes

:::info
For a detailed mapping of all v3 to v4 functions, see the [Function Mapping](../reference/v4-function-mapping.mdx) page.
:::

- Changed certain function names to avoid collisions with other scripts or modules.

| Old Name          | New Name / Details                                                  |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Copy-File`       | [`Copy-ADTFile`](../reference/functions/Copy-ADTFile.mdx)           |
| `Execute-Process` | [`Start-ADTProcess`](../reference/functions/Start-ADTProcess.mdx)   |
| `Write-Log`       | [`Write-ADTLogEntry`](../reference/functions/Write-ADTLogEntry.mdx) |

#### Variables

- Changed standard toolkit environment variables, such as `$envProgramFiles`, to become available once an [ADTSession](../reference/adtsession-object.mdx) is opened or after the `Export-ADTEnvironmentTableToSessionState` command is executed
- Changed variables specific to a particular deployment (for example, `$appName`) to be found within the [ADTSession](../reference/adtsession-object.mdx) object (for example, `$adtSession.AppName`)

#### Booleans Replaced with Switches

Changed from many Boolean parameters in v3 (some defaulting to `true` and others to `false`) to a clearer switch-based system. It was not always clear what the default behavior was without referencing documentation.

- Changed from `TopMost` `$true` or `-TopMost` `$false` to a single optional switch, `-NotTopMost`, which clarifies that the default behavior is `TopMost`

#### Standardized Filtering

Changed the `Remove-MsiApplications` command from v3 that used `-FilterApplication` and `-ExcludeFromUninstall` parameters with a complex syntax. In the new function, [Uninstall-ADTApplication](../reference/functions/Uninstall-ADTApplication.mdx), these have been **replaced** with a single `-FilterScript`, similar to PowerShell's `Where-Object`:

```powershell
-FilterScript { $_.Publisher -eq 'Oracle Corporation' -and $_.DisplayVersion -notmatch 'Java 8 Update 45' }
```

#### ScriptBlock Variables

Changed from `Invoke-HKCURegistrySettingsForAllUsers` in v3 that required a `$UserProfile` variable. In v4, [Invoke-ADTAllUsersRegistryAction](../reference/functions/Invoke-ADTAllUsersRegistryAction.mdx) pipes user profile objects to the provided scriptblock, so you can use `$_`:

```powershell
Invoke-ADTAllUsersRegistryAction -ScriptBlock {
    Set-ADTRegistryKey -Key 'HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Common' -Name 'qmenable' -Value 0 -Type DWord -SID $_.SID
}
```

#### Standardized Array Inputs

Changed functions that accept multiple values to take arrays rather than comma-delimited strings. For example, **instead of**:

```powershell
Show-InstallationWelcome -CloseApps 'iexplore,winword,excel'
```

you can specify:

```powershell
Show-ADTInstallationWelcome -CloseProcesses iexplore, winword, excel
```

#### Error Handling

Changed from many commands in v3 that used a `-ContinueOnError` parameter. In v4, you use the standard PowerShell `-ErrorAction` parameter:

- Changed from `-ContinueOnError` `$true` or `$false` to `-ErrorAction` `Stop` or `-ErrorAction` `SilentlyContinue`

#### Uninstallation of EXE Apps

Added support for [Uninstall-ADTApplication](../reference/functions/Uninstall-ADTApplication.mdx) to uninstall **EXE** apps in addition to **MSI**. Specify the `-ApplicationType` parameter to focus on one type or the other. The `-ArgumentList` parameter replaces any detected arguments in the registry, and `-AdditionalArgumentList` appends to them.

#### User Profile Paths

Added `-LoadProfilePaths` switch to [Get-ADTUserProfiles](../reference/functions/Get-ADTUserProfiles.mdx) to discover common folders within user profiles, such as **Documents** and **Desktop**. You can use [Copy-ADTFileToUserProfiles](../reference/functions/Copy-ADTFileToUserProfiles.mdx) to copy files directly to these locations.

#### WIM Support

Added support for compressing file content into a `WIM` archive and mounting it during installation. You can manage this manually using [Mount-ADTWimFile](../reference/functions/Mount-ADTWimFile.mdx) and [Dismount-ADTWimFile](../reference/functions/Dismount-ADTWimFile.mdx), or you can use the `-ForceWimDetection` switch with [Open-ADTSession](../reference/functions/Open-ADTSession.mdx) to auto-mount and dismount any `WIM` files found.

Added [Zero Config](../deployment-concepts/zero-config-deployment.mdx) feature that starts automatically if you leave the **AppName** blank, mounts any `WIM` file found, and installs the `MSI` located inside.
