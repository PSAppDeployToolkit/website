# How to download PSAppDeployToolkit

PSAppDeployToolkit is available as a module on the PowerShell Gallery or as a self-contained zip file archive on GitHub, which includes the PSAppDeployToolkit module. Both downloads provide the functions required to scaffold a new deployment.

## Installing from the PowerShell Gallery

You can install the PSAppDeployToolkit module from the PowerShell Gallery by running:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name PSAppDeployToolkit -Scope CurrentUser
```

## Grabbing the archive / zip files from GitHub releases

Alternatively, you can download the release assets:

- [PSAppDeployToolkit Latest Release](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit/releases)

Here you will see the latest release of PSAppDeployToolkit. Click the `Assets` dropdown to view the available downloads. You should see the following:

| **Filename**                         | **Description**                                                                               |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PSAppDeployToolkit_ModuleOnly.zip`  | Zip file containing the latest version of the module. At a minimum, you should download this. |
| `PSAppDeployToolkit_Template_v3.zip` | Zip file containing the v3 template. Contains the scaffold for a v3 compatible deployment.    |
| `PSAppDeployToolkit_Template_v4.zip` | Zip file containing the v4 template. Contains the scaffold for a v4 native deployment.        |
| `Source code (zip)`                  | Zip file containing the source code.                                                          |

Once extracted, you will see a file and folder structure similar to the one described on the next page.

## Downloading PSAppDeployToolkit.Tools

PSAppDeployToolkit.Tools is a companion module designed for functions that help you create packages rather than deploy them.

At present, this is in pre-release status, so installing from the PowerShell Gallery requires an additional switch:

```powershell
Install-Module PSAppDeployToolkit.Tools -Scope CurrentUser -AllowPreRelease
```

If this produces an error that the -AllowPreRelease parameter is not recognized, then first update PowerShellGet and then restart your PowerShell console:

```powershell
Install-Module PowerShellGet -Force -Scope CurrentUser
```

Alternatively, you can download the release assets:

- [PSAppDeployToolkit.Tools Latest Release](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit.Tools/releases/latest)
