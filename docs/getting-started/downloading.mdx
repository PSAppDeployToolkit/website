## Downloading PSAppDeployToolkit v4

PSAppDeployToolkit is provided as a module via the PowerShell Gallery, and a self-contained Zip file archive via GitHub, which contains the PSAppDeployToolkit module. Both downloads contain the functions required to scaffold a new deployment.

You can install the PSAppDeployToolkit module from the PowerShell Gallery using the following:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name PSAppDeployToolkit -Scope CurrentUser
```

Alternatively, you can download the release assets:

- [PSAppDeployToolkit Latest Release](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit/releases/latest).

Here you'll see the latest release of PSAppDeployToolkit. Click on the `Assets` dropdown to see the available downloads. You should see the following:

| Filename  | Description  |
|---|---|
| `PSAppDeployToolkit.zip`  | Zip file containing the latest version of the module. At a minimum, you should download this. |
| `PSAppDeployToolkit_Template_v3.zip` | Zip file containing the v3 template. Contains the scaffold for a v3 compatible deployment. |
| `PSAppDeployToolkit_Template_v4.zip` | Zip file containing the v4 template. Contains the scaffold for a v4 native deployment. |
| `Source code (zip)` | Zip file containing the uncompiled source code. |

Once the main zip file is extracted, you will see a file and folder structure similar to the one outlined on the next page.
