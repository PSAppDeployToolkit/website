# Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
  <summary>Everything has changed! Where do I begin?</summary>

  Some useful links to get you started:

  - [Changes in v4](../getting-started/changes-in-v4.mdx)
  - [v4 Function Mapping](../reference/v4-function-mapping.mdx)
  - [Migrating from v3](../getting-started/migrating-from-v3.mdx)

</details>

<details>
  <summary>I've installed and imported the module - where are my toolkit variables?</summary>

  Environment variables are not available until you have either opened an ADTSession or called the [Export-ADTEnvironmentTableToSessionState](../reference/functions/Export-ADTEnvironmentTableToSessionState.mdx) command.

  This is handled automatically within the deployment script.

  Variables specific to a particular deployment, such as `$appName` and `$appVersion`, are now stored in the [$adtSession](../reference/adtsession-object.mdx) object.

  For details, see the [Variables](../reference/variables.mdx) page.

<details>
  <summary>Why do I get the error "A PSAppDeployToolkit assembly of a different file hash is already loaded"?</summary>

  Once DLLs are loaded into PowerShell, they cannot be unloaded. If the module detects that a mismatching version has already been imported in the current PowerShell session, this error is thrown.

  Restart PowerShell, or use a separate shell for testing your deployment. You can also prevent this by making sure your installed version of the module and your application package are on the same latest version.

  <summary>Why can't I get the new Fluent UI to work with my v3 scripts in compatibility mode?</summary>

  The new Fluent UI has additional parameters, such as SubTitle, which are not part of the Classic UI.

  For full compatibility with v3 scripts, only the Classic UI is enabled in compatibility mode.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why can't I get the new Fluent UI to work with PowerShell ISE?</summary>

  Unfortunately, issues with the PowerShell host in the ISE make it incompatible with the new Fluent UI.

  You can still develop in the ISE, but you should use a separate PowerShell instance to launch and test your deployment. Alternatively, use another IDE like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Do we need to deploy this module to our endpoints?</summary>

  It is not required, as a copy of the module is included in the deployment template we provide for download (or that you can generate using the `New-ADTTemplate` command).

  However, you also have the option to remove the PSAppDeployToolkit folder from this template and pre-install the module on each device.

  **Pros**:
  - Packages are smaller and faster to download.
  - Updating the module means all packages get the latest updates and UI improvements.

  **Cons**:
  - You must figure out how to deploy the module to all devices before any packages that depend on the module run.
  - There is a risk in running a previously tested deployment against a newer module version if it was not tested against it, due to potential bugs or breaking changes.

  <summary>How can I update the version of the toolkit that my package uses?</summary>

  To update a PSAppDeployToolkit v3 package to v4, there is a `Convert-ADTDeployment` command in the companion [PSAppDeployToolkit.Tools](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit.Tools) module (see [Migrating from v3](../getting-started/migrating-from-v3) for further details).

  To update a v4 package to a newer version, because the config and asset folders are externalized, you can simply replace the PSAppDeployToolkit folder with the new version. There should be no breaking changes if you apply a patch release (for example, upgrading from 4.0.0 to 4.0.4).

  However, for major or minor upgrades (for example, 4.0 to 4.1 or 5.0), review the release notes and documentation for any necessary configuration file changes.

<details>
  <summary>Will PSAppDeployToolkit ever get support for WinGet?</summary>

  There are no immediate plans to include this directly in the toolkit, but there is a community extension that provides this functionality:

  - [GitHub](https://github.com/mjr4077au/PSAppDeployToolkit.WinGet)
  - [PSGallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSAppDeployToolkit.WinGet)

<details>
  <summary>How do I get the UI to display with an Intune deployment?</summary>

  For 4.0.x and below, ServiceUI.exe is required to display the UI in an Intune deployment. A helper script is available to facilitate this:

  [Invoke-ServiceUI](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit/tree/main/examples/ServiceUI)

  A future version of the toolkit may handle this natively by running the UI components as a separate user process.

<details>
  <summary>How can I control when retries will occur after the defer option is selected?</summary>

  A 1602 error code is returned when the defer option is selected.

  With ConfigMgr, you could configure DeferExitCode in config.psd1 to be 1618 (Fast Retry). The Fast Retry interval is configurable via ConfigMgr policy.

  However, with Intune the fast retry period is much shorter and not configurable, meaning it will re-attempt within minutes. You can add the new `-DeferRunInterval` parameter to `Show-ADTInstallationWelcome` to abort installation if processes need to be close and the installation was recently deferred within the selected timespan.

  Scheduling a task to retry later has been discussed, but it involves multiple issues like the need to cache the package, the risk of concurrent installs, and the exit code not being reported back to Intune.

  <summary>Can I use PSAppDeployToolkit to install user-context apps?</summary>

  Yes. Set the `RequireAdmin` option in Config.psd1 to `$false` if the installation does not require administrative rights.
