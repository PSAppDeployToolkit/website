# Deployment Structure

## V4 Native Deployment Template


The v4 native deployment structure is designed to be more modular, flexible, and user-friendly than the v3 structure, while still containing all core PSADT module files.

The PSADT v4 native deployment structure is considerably more complex than v3, since it contains the entire PSADT module. However, we can limit your exposure to the complexity by focusing on just the files you need to know about:

```
Invoke-AppDeployToolkit.ps1             # PSADT Deployment PowerShell script
Invoke-AppDeployToolkit.exe             # PSADT Deployment executable (to easily launch the above script)

├───Files                               # Primary installation files#
├───SupportFiles                        # Supporting resources or assets
│
├───PSAppDeployToolkit                  # PSADT module files. Please do not modify anything under this folder.
│   PSAppDeployToolkit.psd1             # PSADT module manifest. Import this if you want to use the module in your own scripts.
│   PSAppDeployToolkit.psm1             # PSADT module script. Contains all the functions and logic.

## V3 Compatibility Deployment Template

The v3 compatibility deployment structure is designed to allow you to use an existing v3 deployment script with the v4 PSADT framework. This v3 compatibility structure allows you to leverage your existing v3 script paths and function references, mapping them to their new v4 equivalents. The structure is laid out similarly to v4, however some file and folder names are kept the same as v3. This is so that we can use leverage any file paths you may have used within your script. And we also leverage the folder structure to impersonate the v3 PSADT framework, while remapping each function to the new v4 equivilent. This allows you to use your existing v3 deployment scripts with the v4 PSADT framework, allowing you to take advantage of the new features and improvements in v4, but without having to make any functional change to your existing script.

The PSADT v4 compatibility deployment structure is considerably more complex than v3, since it contains the entire PSADT module. However, we can limit your exposure to the complexity by focusing on just the files you need to know about:

```
Deploy-Application.ps1                   # PSADT Deployment PowerShell script
Deploy-Application.exe                   # PSADT Deployment executable (to easily launch the above script)
