# Zero-Configuration MSI Deployment

## Simple Deployment Method

Now that you understand the basics of how a deployment works, you can try a simple MSI-based deployment with no effort. PSAppDeployToolkit has a zero-config MSI install feature which allows you to quickly execute an installation with zero configuration of the `Invoke-AppDeployToolkit.ps1` file.

To use this feature:

1. Ensure the AppName is left empty in `Invoke-AppDeployToolkit.ps1` to activate the zero-config feature.
2. Place your MSI file into the `Files` folder of the PSAppDeployToolkit deployment template. This method only support the installation of one MSI, so if more than one MSI is found, then only the first one is selected.
3. If you have an MST file, then also place this into the `Files` folder. The MST file must have the same name as the MSI file. For example, if your MSI file name is `test01.msi`, then the MST file must be named `test01.mst`.
4. If you have any MSP files, then also place them into the `Files` folder. You can place more than one MSP file in the folder, but you must name the files in alphabetical order to control the order in which they are installed.
5. You can also compress all of these files along with any other installation content required into a WIM file, and it will be automatically mounted and used.
