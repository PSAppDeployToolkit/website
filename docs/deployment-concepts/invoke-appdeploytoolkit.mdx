## Deployment Script

The `Invoke-AppDeployToolkit.ps1` script is where you will spend most of your time when using PSAppDeployToolkit. This script is the main entry point of the deployment, responsible for executing the deployment phases.

### Understanding the Deployment Script Architecture

PSAppDeployToolkit v4 uses a session-based architecture to provide flexible control over the deployment process. Understanding this architecture is crucial for both beginners and advanced users.

### Core Concepts

#### ADTSession Object

The heart of PSADT v4 is the `ADTSession` object, which encapsulates all deployment state, configuration, and context. This object-oriented approach provides better isolation, state management, and extensibility compared to the global variable approach used in v3.

#### Session Properties

These are the first thing to edit in your deployment script and are stored within the `ADTSession` object, providing better encapsulation and state management compared to global variables in v3. Session Properties define your application's metadata, behavior, and deployment requirements.

| Property              | Example                                                    | Description                                                                           |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `AppVendor`           | `Microsoft`                                                | The vendor name of the application                                                    |
| `AppName`             | `Office 365`                                               | The name of the application                                                           |
| `AppVersion`          | `16.0`                                                     | The version of the application                                                        |
| `AppArch`             | `x64`                                                      | The architecture of the application (x86 or x64)                                      |
| `AppLang`             | `EN`                                                       | The language of the application                                                       |
| `AppRevision`         | `01`                                                       | The revision of the application package                                               |
| `AppSuccessExitCodes` | `@(0)`                                                     | Exit codes that indicate success                                                      |
| `AppRebootExitCodes`  | `@(1641, 3010)`                                            | Exit codes that indicate a reboot is required                                         |
| `AppProcessesToClose` | `@(@{ Name = 'winword'; Description = 'Microsoft Word' })` | **New in v4.1**. Processes that should be closed before install / uninstall / repair. |
| `RequireAdmin`        | `$true`                                                    | **New in v4.1**. Whether the script requires administrative privileges                |

:::warning Breaking Changes in v4.1
If you are upgrading from v4.0 or earlier, you must move any `RequireAdmin` setting from your config file to the session object in your deployment script, and use `AppProcessesToClose` instead of specifying the processes directly on the `-CloseProcesses` parameter of `Show-ADTInstallationWelcome`.
:::

:::info New in v4.1: RequireAdmin
PSADT v4.1 contains a new variable `RequireAdmin` that allows you to check for administrative rights on a per-application basis without needing to modify the PSADT configuration file.

- `RequireAdmin = $true`, will fail the deployment if admin rights are not available.
- `RequireAdmin = $false`, will run in the users context without requiring administrative rights.
:::

:::info New in v4.1: AppProcessesToClose
PSADT v4.1 contains a new variable `AppProcessesToClose` that allows you to specify processes to be closed before the installation, uninstallation, or repair phases. This replaces the previous method of using the -CloseApps parameter on `Show-InstallationWelcome`

- `AppProcessesToClose = <populated>`, will automatically close the specified processes before proceeding with the deployment.
:::

:::info
Use hashtable objects on `AppProcessesToClose` with `Name` and `Description` properties for better user experience.

```PowerShell
AppProcessesToClose = @(@{ Name = 'winword'; Description = 'Microsoft Word' })
```

### Deployment Types & Phases

There are three types of deployments you can perform using PSAppDeployToolkit.

- **Install**, **Uninstall** and **Repair**.

Each deployment type (Install, Uninstall, Repair) follows a structured three-phase approach:

- **Pre-Phase**: Preparation, validation, and user interaction
- **Main Phase**: Core deployment operations
- **Post-Phase**: Cleanup, configuration, and finalization

#### Understanding Deployment Phases

Each deployment phase serves a specific purpose in the deployment lifecycle. Understanding these phases is crucial for creating effective deployment scripts.

##### Pre-Phase Operations

The Pre-Phase is responsible for preparation, validation, and user interaction:

**Common Pre-Phase Tasks:**

- Display welcome messages and user notifications
- Check system requirements and prerequisites
- Close conflicting applications
- Handle user deferrals and scheduling
- Validate installation media and files
- Check disk space and system resources
- Uninstall previous versions if required

##### Main Phase Operations

The Main Phase performs the core deployment operations:

**Install Phase Tasks:**

- Execute application installer
- Apply transforms and patches
- Configure application settings
- Handle installation errors and rollback

**Uninstall Phase Tasks:**

- Execute application uninstaller
- Remove application files and registry entries
- Clean up user data (if configured)
- Handle uninstall errors

**Repair Phase Tasks:**

- Reinstall or repair application components
- Restore corrupted files
- Reapply configuration settings
- Verify installation integrity

##### Post-Phase Operations

The Post-Phase handles cleanup, configuration, and finalization:

**Common Post-Phase Tasks:**

- Apply registry settings and configurations
- Copy additional files and shortcuts
- Configure user preferences
- Update system settings
- Display completion messages
- Prompt for restart if required
- Clean up temporary files

### Script Structure

The script is broken down into the following sections:

| Install Type              | Phase            | Deployment Tasks                                                                    |

|                           | `Post-Uninstall` | Prompt for restart                                                                  |
|                           |                  |                                                                                     |
| `Repair-ADTDeployment`    | `Pre-Repair`     | Display end user messaging, close processes, uninstall / clean up previous versions |
|                           | `Repair`         | Repair application                                                                  |
|                           | `Post-Repair`    | Drop additional files, registry tweaks, reset settings, prompt for restart          |
