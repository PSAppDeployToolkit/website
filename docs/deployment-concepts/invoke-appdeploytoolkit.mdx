# Deployment Script

The `Invoke-AppDeployToolkit.ps1` script is where you will spend most of your time when using PSAppDeployToolkit. This script is the main entry point for the deployment and is responsible for executing the deployment phases.

## Deployment Types

The script is broken down into three main deployment types:

- `Install`
- `Uninstall`
- `Repair`

## Deployment Phases

Each of these types has three phases:

- `Pre-InstallType`
- `InstallType`
- `Post-InstallType`

## Script

The script is broken down into the following sections:

| **Install Type**          | **Phase**        | **Deployment Tasks**                                                                |
