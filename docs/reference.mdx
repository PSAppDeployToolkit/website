# Reference

PSAppDeployToolkit has an extensive library of functions to simplify common deployment tasks. Every function adheres to the same security standards and best pratices, including documentation. You can find a complete list of functions in the sidebar, or alternatiively,  or by using the search bar.

Pre-defined **Exit Codes** are used to indicate the success or failure of a deployment and can be used to control the flow of your deployment logic, or just to understand what happened during a deployment. You can find a list of Exit Codes, Functions, and ADT Session properties in the sidebar or by using the search bar.

## Something missing?

If you find issues with the documentation or have suggestions on how to improve the documentation or the project in general, please [file an issue](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit/issues) for us.
