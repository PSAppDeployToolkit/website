## SYNOPSIS

Adds a callback function to the nominated hooking point.

## SYNTAX

```powershell
Add-ADTModuleCallback [-Hookpoint] <CallbackType> [-Callback] <CommandInfo[]> [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

This function adds a specified callback function to the nominated hooking point.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1

```powershell
Add-ADTModuleCallback -Hookpoint PostOpen -Callback (Get-Command -Name 'MyCallbackFunction')
```

Adds the specified callback function to be invoked after a DeploymentSession has opened.

## PARAMETERS

### -Hookpoint

Where you wish for the callback to be executed at.

Valid hookpoints are:
* OnInit (The callback is executed before the module is initialized)
* OnStart (The callback is executed before the first deployment session is opened)
* PreOpen (The callback is executed before a deployment session is opened)
* PostOpen (The callback is executed after a deployment session is opened)
* OnDefer (The callback is executed when a user defers the active deployment)
* PreClose (The callback is executed before the deployment session is closed)
* PostClose (The callback is executed after the deployment session is closed)
* OnFinish (The callback is executed before the last deployment session is closed)
* OnExit (The callback is executed after the last deployment session is closed)

Each hook point supports multiple callbacks, each invoked in the order they're added.
