## DESCRIPTION

The following prompts can be included in the welcome dialog:

* Close the specified running applications, or optionally close the applications without showing a prompt (using the `-Silent` switch).
* Defer the deployment a certain number of times, for a certain number of days or until a deadline is reached.
* Countdown until applications are automatically closed.
* Prevent users from launching the specified applications while the deployment is in progress.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1

```powershell
Show-ADTInstallationWelcome -CloseProcesses iexplore, winword, excel
```

Prompt the user to close Internet Explorer, Word and Excel.

### EXAMPLE 2

```powershell
Show-ADTInstallationWelcome -CloseProcesses @{ Name = 'winword' }, @{ Name = 'excel' } -Silent
```

Close Word and Excel without prompting the user.

### EXAMPLE 3

```powershell
Show-ADTInstallationWelcome -CloseProcesses @{ Name = 'winword' }, @{ Name = 'excel' } -BlockExecution
```

Close Word and Excel and prevent the user from launching the applications while the deployment is in progress.

### EXAMPLE 4

```powershell
Show-ADTInstallationWelcome -CloseProcesses @{ Name = 'winword'; Description = 'Microsoft Office Word' }, @{ Name = 'excel'; Description = 'Microsoft Office Excel' } -CloseProcessesCountdown 600
```

Prompt the user to close Word and Excel, with customized descriptions for the applications and automatically close the applications after 10 minutes.

### EXAMPLE 5

```powershell
Show-ADTInstallationWelcome -CloseProcesses @{ Name = 'winword' }, @{ Name = 'msaccess' }, @{ Name = 'excel' } -PersistPrompt
```

Prompt the user to close Word, MSAccess and Excel.
By using the PersistPrompt switch, the dialog will return to the center of the screen every couple of seconds, specified in the config.psd1, so the user cannot ignore it by dragging it aside.

### EXAMPLE 6

```powershell
Show-ADTInstallationWelcome -AllowDefer -DeferDeadline '25/08/2013'
```

Allow the user to defer the deployment until the deadline is reached.

### EXAMPLE 7

```powershell
Show-ADTInstallationWelcome -CloseProcesses @{ Name = 'winword' }, @{ Name = 'excel' } -BlockExecution -AllowDefer -DeferTimes 10 -DeferDeadline '25/08/2013' -CloseProcessesCountdown 600
Close Word and Excel and prevent the user from launching the applications while the deployment is in progress.
```


Allow the user to defer the deployment a maximum of 10 times or until the deadline is reached, whichever happens first.

When deferral expires, prompt the user to close the applications and automatically close them after 10 minutes.

## PARAMETERS

### -CloseProcesses

Name of the process to stop (do not include the .exe).
Specify multiple processes separated by a comma.
Specify custom descriptions like this: `@\{ Name = 'winword'; Description = 'Microsoft Office Word' \}, @\{ Name = 'excel'; Description = 'Microsoft Office Excel' \}`

- To specify 30 minutes, use: `([System.TimeSpan]::FromMinutes(30))`.
- To specify 24 hours, use: `([System.TimeSpan]::FromHours(24))`.

### CommonParameters

This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see [about_CommonParameters](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### None

### You cannot pipe objects to this function.
## OUTPUTS

### None

### This function does not return any output.
## NOTES
An active ADT session is NOT required to use this function.

The process descriptions are retrieved via Get-Process, with a fall back on the process name if no description is available.
Alternatively, you can specify the description yourself with a '=' symbol - see examples.

The dialog box will timeout after the timeout specified in the config.psd1 file (default 55 minutes) to prevent Intune/SCCM deployments from timing out and returning a failure code.
When the dialog times out, the script will exit and return a 1618 code (SCCM fast retry code).
