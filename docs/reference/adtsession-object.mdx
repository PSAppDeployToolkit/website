# ADTSession Object

The `ADTSession` object is a core component of the **PSAppDeployToolkit** that manages the state and information throughout a deployment session. It captures essential details about the deployment environment and provides convenient properties and methods for use in your scripts.

## Initialization

When you start a deployment script, initialize the `ADTSession` with the `Start-ADTSession` function:

```powershell
Start-ADTSession -AppName "YourAppName" -AppVersion "1.0.0" -AppVendor "YourVendor" -DeploymentType "Install"
```

This initializes the session, gathers information about the deployment, the user, and the computer, and makes several helpful properties available for you to use.
