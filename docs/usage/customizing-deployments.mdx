# Customizing Deployments

Aside from customizing the `Invoke-AppDeployToolkit.ps1` script, no configuration is required by default. However, these components are configurable:

### Config

Use config.psd1 to configure items such as:

- Are Admin rights required
- MSI parameters
- Log settings

See [Config Settings](/docs/reference/config-settings.mdx) for further information.

It is recommended to edit file located in the Config folder of the deployment template, rather than the copy located inside of the module itself.

#### Logging

The PSAppDeployToolkit generates extensive logging for all toolkit and MSI operations.

The default log folder for the PSAppDeployToolkit and MSI log files can be specified in config.psd1. The default folder is `C:\Windows\Logs\Software`.

The PSAppDeployToolkit log file is named after the application with \_PSAppDeployToolkit appended to the end, e.g.

- `Oracle_JavaRuntime_1.7.0.17_EN_01_PSAppDeployToolkit.log`

All MSI actions are logged and the log file is named according to the MSI file used on the command line, with the action appended to the log file name. For uninstallation, the MSI product code is resolved to the MSI application name and version to keep the same log file format, e.g.

- `Oracle_JavaRuntimeEnvironmentx86_1.7.0.17_EN_01_Install.log`
- `Oracle_JavaRuntimeEnvironmentx86_1.7.0.17_EN_01_Repair.log`
- `Oracle_JavaRuntimeEnvironmentx86_1.7.0.17_EN_01_Patch.log`
- `Oracle_JavaRuntimeEnvironmentx86_1.7.0.17_EN_01_Uninstall.log`

Enable `CompressLogs` in `config.psd1` to collect log files in a temporary folder and zip them at the end of the installation or uninstallation.

One of the options in config.psd1 is **CompressLogs**. Enabling this option will create a temporary logging folder where you can save all of the log files you want to include in the single ZIP file that will be created from this folder. When set to True, the following happens:

- Both toolkit and MSI logs are temporally placed in a temp folder, the path of which is set in `$adtSession.LogTempFolder` and defaults to `$envTemp\$installName`.
- At the end of the install / uninstall, the logs are compressed into a new zip file which is placed in the LogFolder location in the config file, and the temp folder is deleted.
- The Zip file name indicates whether it is an Install / Uninstall and has the timestamp in the filename so previous logs do not get overwritten.
- If your package creates other log files, you can send them to the temporary logging folder at `$adtSession.LogTempFolder`.

### Strings

Configure the default UI messages. The Strings folder contains the English version of strings.psd1 in the root, with other languages in their respective subfolders.

See [Language Strings](/docs/reference/language-strings.mdx) for further information.

### Assets

To brand the Fluent UI dialogs with a custom logo, replace `AppIcon.png` with your own file, retaining the file name. For Classic UI dialogs, replace `Banner.Classic.png`.

To brand the Classic UI dialogs with your own custom/corporate banner, replace the `Banner.Classic.png` file with your own .png file (retaining the file name). The file must be in PNG format and must be 450 x 50 in size.
